### **The Echoes of Eldermere**  

Eldermere was a quiet town nestled between rolling hills and a dense forest that locals called **Whisperwood**. The town had stood for centuries, its cobbled streets and ivy-covered houses whispering stories of generations past. But of all the tales told in Eldermere, none were as famous—or as feared—as the legend of **The Echoes**.  

For as long as anyone could remember, strange voices had been heard at dusk near the abandoned manor on the hill. Some said they were the voices of long-lost souls, forever repeating their final words. Others dismissed it as the wind playing tricks on old ears.  

No one dared to investigate.  

That is, until **Elias Carter** arrived.  

Elias was not a superstitious man. A historian by trade, he had spent years traveling across forgotten villages, collecting legends and tracing their origins. When he heard of The Echoes of Eldermere, he saw it as nothing more than another myth waiting to be unraveled.  

Armed with his notebook, a lantern, and an audio recorder, Elias made his way toward the manor at sunset. The house loomed ahead, its silhouette jagged against the fading sky. It had once belonged to the Ashford family, who had mysteriously vanished over a century ago.  

As he stepped inside, the floor groaned under his weight. Dust covered every surface, and broken furniture lay scattered like forgotten relics. Elias set his recorder on a table and let the silence settle.  

Then, at exactly **seven o’clock**, the air **shifted**.  

A whisper, faint but distinct, brushed against his ear.  

_"You shouldn't have come."_

Elias froze. The voice had not come from his recorder—it had come from **behind him**.  

Spinning around, he saw nothing but shadows. His heart pounded, but he steadied himself. The air felt heavier, charged with an unexplainable energy.  

He took a step forward.  

Another whisper.  

_"Leave while you can."_

The words were urgent, almost pleading. Elias frowned. Ghost stories were often born from fear and misunderstanding, but something about this felt **different**.  

Then, he saw it.  

At the end of the hallway, where the darkness was thickest, a door stood ajar. A flickering light spilled from within.  

Slowly, cautiously, Elias approached.  

As he pushed the door open, a gust of cold air rushed past him. Inside, the room was untouched by time—unlike the rest of the manor, everything here was pristine. A fireplace crackled despite the absence of wood. A clock on the wall **ticked backward**.  

And in the center of the room stood a woman in an old-fashioned dress.  

She turned to face him, her eyes wide with a mixture of sorrow and relief.  

_"You can see me,"_ she whispered.  

Elias swallowed hard. He had expected echoes of the past, residual sounds—**not this**.  

"Who are you?" he asked.  

The woman stepped forward.  

_"My name is Eleanor Ashford. And I have been trapped here for over a hundred years."_  

A cold chill ran down Elias's spine. "Trapped how?"  

_"This house exists between moments,"_ Eleanor said. _"An echo of time itself. We were caught in it when we tried to escape that night."_

Elias felt the air around him tighten. "Escape from what?"  

Eleanor's expression darkened.  

_"From him."_  

Before Elias could ask, the temperature plummeted. The fire in the hearth **vanished**. The shadows stretched, curling around the edges of the room. And then—**footsteps**.  

Heavy. Slow. **Coming closer.**  

_"You have to go!"_ Eleanor grabbed his arm. _"If he sees you—"_  

A deep, **inhuman growl** echoed through the walls.  

Elias didn’t need convincing. He bolted, Eleanor’s voice fading behind him. The house seemed to **shift**, the hallways twisting and stretching impossibly. Doors led to places they shouldn’t. The front entrance was **gone**.  

A voice, deep and guttural, whispered through the air.  

_"You are mine now."_  

Elias felt something claw at his mind, pulling him backward into the darkness. Desperately, he reached for his recorder—he had turned it on before entering. If he could just capture **proof**, someone would know what happened to him.  

Then—**light**.  

A brilliant, golden flash exploded around him. The shadows **screamed**, recoiling as Eleanor appeared once more, her hands outstretched.  

_"Run!"_  

Elias didn’t hesitate. The house **shuddered**, walls groaning as he charged forward. And then—**he was outside**.  

The manor stood before him, silent and lifeless as if nothing had happened. The sky had darkened completely.  

His hands trembled as he reached for his recorder. He pressed play.  

Static.  

Then—**a voice**.  

_"You shouldn't have come."_  

Elias's blood ran cold.  

The exact words he had heard inside.  

But then—**another voice**. One he didn’t recognize.  

_"He will return."_  

Elias exhaled, staring up at the manor. The town of Eldermere had long whispered about The Echoes.  

Now, he knew why.  

And he knew they weren’t just echoes.  

**They were warnings.**
